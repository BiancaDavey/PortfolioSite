This hobby project is a novelty "mini" computer made with Raspberry Pi 4 and a case made from a repurposed novelty radio. This project involved:

- Removing the FM radio components (no longer functioning) from the novelty computer-shaped radio and drilling holes for cables
- Installing Raspberry Pi OS on a Raspberry Pi 4 and connecting a small display screen
- Repurposing the FM radio case to hold the display screen
- Creating a simple Python program using the guizero library to display a selection of gifs
